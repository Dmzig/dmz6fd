Once upon a time


There was a dragon, and a Dover Demon walking around Dover, Massachusetts.
The dragon breathed his firey breath
The Dover Demon was terrorizing people with it's large head and tendril-like fingers. 
Then, Agent Buckwald the Wizard appeared and froze the dragon and Dover Demon.
The wizard used all of his energy keeping them frozen, waiting until a worthy hero would rise up to slay them.
A noble hero stumbled upon the frozen foes and thought to himself, “If only I were 20 years younger, I could slay these here vermin and relive my days of glory!” 
Little did he know that Agent Buckwald the wizard had secretly been working on to form a Link to the Past.

The noble hero, Zelda, and the wizard formed an allegiance and began work on a Temple of Time.
It was in this temple of time the two hoped they could send our noble hero in his green pointed hat back in time. 
Agent Buckwald the Wizard and Zelda worked hard on finding a way to send Zelda back 20 years to slay the dragon. 
While in the lab, Agent Buckwald noted 'You look familiar.... Isn't your name actually Link...?' 
The end.
