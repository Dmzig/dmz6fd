Once upon a time


There was a dragon, and a Dover Demon walking around Dover, Massachusetts.
The dragon breathed his firey breath
The Dover Demon was terrorizing people with it's large head and tendril-like fingers. 
Then, Agent Buckwald the Wizard appeared and froze the dragon and Dover Demon.
The wizard used all of his energy keeping them frozen, waiting until a worthy hero would rise up to slay them.

A noble hero stumbled upon the frozen foes and thought to himself, “If only I were 20 years younger, I could slay these here vermin and relive my days of glory!”Little did he know that Agent Buckwald the wizard had secretly been working on to form a Link to the Past.
The end.
