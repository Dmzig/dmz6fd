Once upon a time


There was a dragon, and a Dover Demon walking around Dover, Massachusetts.
The dragon breathed his firey breath
The Dover Demon was terrorizing people with it's large head and tendril-like fingers. 
Then, Agent Buckwald the Wizard appeared and froze the dragon and Dover Demon.
The wizard used all of his energy keeping them frozen, waiting until a worthy hero would rise up to slay them.

The end.
